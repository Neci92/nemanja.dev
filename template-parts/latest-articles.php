                    <p>You have started learning web development and web design. You were typing those tags on codecademy.com and you know that < h1 > is the big one, < h2 > is slightly smaller and < p > is the regular text. If you add < div > and < img > you can set the markup for almost any design, so why do we have all those tags and what’s their purpose? Then you learn some CSS and you realize that with your new skills you can make smaller < h2 > to appear bigger than the big one < h1 >. So what is the catch? How should you structure your code and take the most of HTML?</p>
